## How does it work?
1. Create a new directory (with unique slug) for every new code snippet that you want to show.
2. Visit `code-for-ghost` project's domain and get your unique `iframe URL` (or `ID` to be used with the injected script).
3. Paste that iframe code on your blog.

Done ✅

## How can I update code snippets?
Just update your code snippet wherever you need to. It would automatically trigger an update on your blog.
